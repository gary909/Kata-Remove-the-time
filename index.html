    <p>
        You're re-designing a blog and the blog's posts have the following format for showing <br>
        the date and time a post was made:<br>
        <br>
        Weekday Month Day, time e.g., Friday May 2, 7pm<br>
        <br>
        You're running out of screen real estate, and on some pages you want to display a shorter <br>
        format, Weekday Month Day that omits the time.<br>
        <br>
        Write a function, shortenToDate, that takes the Website date/time in its original string <br>
        format, and returns the shortened format.<br>
        <br>
        Assume shortenToDate's input will always be a string, e.g. "Friday May 2, 7pm". Assume<br> 
        shortenToDate's output will be the shortened string, e.g., "Friday May 2".<br>
